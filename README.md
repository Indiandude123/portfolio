# Anamitra Singha | GitHub Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio website! I'm Anamitra, a Master's student in Information Technology under the supervision of Prof. Aaditeshwar Seth. I currently work in the area of Artificial Intelligence which might try to bring about some positive impact at a socio-economic level. Here, you‚Äôll find a selection of my projects that reflect my expertise in the areas like machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning and Artificial Intelligence in general. This page still is under construction as there are a few more bits of information to add.

## üßë‚Äçüéì About Me
I was born in Durgapur, West Bengal, India but I spent most of my school life in Kolkata, West Bengal, India. Post school I went on to do my B.Tech in Biotechnology from National Institute of Technology Durgapur. I spent my best few years there but unfortunately the pandemic of 2020 caused me to be locked at home for a significant time of my college life. In my 3rd year of undergraduation, I started gathering interest in the area of Artificial Intelligence, I got myself accepted as an internship at Indian Institute of Technology, Patna under the guidance of Prof. Sriparna Saha. Towards the end of my undergraduation I got placed as a Senior Analyst at Capgemini, during my job I realized I wanted to pursue a master's degree in Computer Science from India itself and I started my preparation for GATE in the same time. I cracked GATE and then I got an admit IIT Delhi for my master's degree in Information Technology. A summary of it is just below. 
- **Education**: 
  - *M.S. by Research in Information Technology*, IIT Delhi (2023 ‚Äì Present)
  - *B.Tech in Biotechnology*, NIT Durgapur (2018 ‚Äì 2022)

- **Experience**: Senior Analyst, Backend Engineering (Capgemini)
- **Internship**: Research Intern, IIT Patna
